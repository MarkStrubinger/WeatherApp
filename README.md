# WeatherApp
A simple Weather App, made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node &amp; Express, EJS Templates, and Tailwind CSS. Deployed to Heroku.

Made in conjunction with the OpenWeather API.

Tailwind CSS was used for styling the pages. A minimalistic approach was taken for the aesthetic design.

EJS Templating allowed for greater flexibility in customizing the site. Using data received from the API, a different EJS page is rendered based on the Weather Icon that is sent.
This will also affect whether the SVG icon is that of a sun or moon, depending on the time, if a sun or moon icon is set to display.

There is a page set for:
Sun (no clouds)
Moon (no clouds)
Cloudy
Rain
Snow

Each has a different background gradient made with Tailwind CSS to differentiate it.

Takes a simple city name, and will display a page with: 

Current Date

CST Time

Name of City

SVG Icon graphic for Weather

OpenWeather weather description subtitle

Current Temperature (Fahrenheit)

Heat Index subtitle

Heat Index with SVG Logo (Fahrenheit)
